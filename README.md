# Capstone Project: CREEPY(pen)NE

Travel Log is an app that makes journaling on the go simple! Whether you're on top of a mountain or riding a crowded bus in Thailand - you can't always carry your laptop with you to record your travel adventures. With this app on your phone, you can easily store all the important stuff right on your device! Click on the map to mark the location of your journal entry, then create a new entry from there. You can also create an entry without a location if locations aren't your thing. Additionally, you can upload images that will be displayed alongside your journal entry. Entries are listed anti-chronologically, but if you need to find a specific one fast, you can search entries by tags - or on the map. That way, when a fellow traveler asks you the name of the place where you saw orangutans in the wild, you don't have to sing the entire jungle-trek song in your head in order to remember the name of the town. With the click of a button, you can edit or delete entire entries or just single photos. In short, Travel Log provides an easy and convenient way to store your memories, leaving you more time for adventures!
